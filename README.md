## delta-illusion :magic_wand:

### delta-illusion is a tool to get 64 passwords with 1(0.5 + 0.5) password.

- :shield: After specifying the password you want to use, you can save the results somewhere if you want. but I don't recommend it, instead it will be more helpful and "safe" if you just keep in mind the "number" of the result.
- :pill: Example: `x@protonmail.com = 17`
- :pill: Example: `Instagram = 16`
- :pill: Example: `Spotify = 67`
- :heavy_check_mark: Since the argv function is not used, there is no trace in your command history.
- :heavy_check_mark: I recommend that the second password you use should contain uppercase letters and symbols. It will be a reasonable feature for applications that require capital letters and symbols.
