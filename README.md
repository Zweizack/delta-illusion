## delta-illusion :magic_wand:

### delta-illusion is a tool to get 64 passwords with 1(0.5 + 0.5) password.

- Since the argv function is not used, there is no trace in your command history.
- After specifying the password you want to use, you can save the results somewhere if you want. but I don't recommend it, instead it will be more helpful and "safe" if you just keep in mind the "number" of the result.
- Example: `x@protonmail.com = 17`
- Example: `Instagram = 16`
- Example: `Spotify = 67`
